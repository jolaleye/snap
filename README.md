Snap allows you to save, organize, and use boilerplates quickly and easily. When you find yourself using the same starting files for multiple projects just run `snap save starter`, and when you need to use that starter project again: `snap starter my-project`. It's that easy.

## Installation

```
npm install -g snap
```

## Usage

### save

Saving a boilerplate with Snap is quick and easy:

```
snap save <name> [source] [options]
```

`<name>` should be something memorable and short so that you can use it later. `[source]` can be a local path to a directory (e.g. `./starter`) or a Git repository URL (e.g. `https://github.com/user/starter.git`). Providing a source is optional. If you don't, the current working directory will be saved.

**Options:**
  - `-o`, `--overwrite`: Overwrite an existing boilerplate that has the same name

### snap

When you want to use a boilerplate you have saved, run:

```
snap <boilerplate-name> <project-directory> [options]
```

`<boilerplate-name>` should be the name of a boilerplate you have saved. `<project-directory>` should be a local path to the project you want to create. For example, if you want to create a project called *my-project* with a boilerplate called *starter*, you should run `snap starter ./my-project`.

**Options:**
  - `-i`, `--install`: Automatically run `npm install` after creating the project

### ls

If you want to see what you have saved:

```
snap ls
```

You'll either get a nice list of names or a message telling you that you don't have anything saved yet.

### show

To view the file structure of a boilerplate:

```
snap show <name>
```

`<name>` should be the name of a boilerplate you have saved.

### rm

When you no longer need a boilerplate and want to delete it:

```
snap rm <names...>
```

You can provide one or more names of boilerplates you have saved.
