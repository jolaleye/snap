# Contributing to Snap

:tada: First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute! :tada:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Snap, not strict rules. Use your best judgement and feel free to propose changes to this document with a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

Be sure that you are making a positive impact on this project and its community. By participating, you are expected to uphold the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please report unacceptable behavior to j.olaleye.o@gmail.com. Be a good person and remember the human.

## How Can I Contribute?

First time contributing? You can learn more about contributing to open source projects through GitHub's [wonderful open source guides](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

### Reporting a Bug :bug:

Before you open a new issue, check to see if the problem has [already been reported](https://github.com/jolaleye/snap/issues). If it has and **the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of creating a new one.

> **Note:** If you find a **closed** issue that seems to address the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original one.

When you open an issue, explain the problem clearly to help maintainers reproduce and fix the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Give a clear and concise description** of what the problem is.
- **Provide clear steps** to reproduce the issue. Explain both what you did and **how** you did it.
- **Describe what you expected** to happen.
- **Include screenshots or animated GIFs** if necessary that show you following the described steps and clearly show the problem.

You'll also see this information when you open an issue, so don't worry if you forget some of the points.

### Requesting a Feature :bulb:

The goal of Snap is to provide a simple and flexible tool to save and organize boilerplates so that later you can start projects in a snap :wink:. It's meant to be easy to learn and easy to use. Before you request a new feature, consider whether the idea fits the scope of this project. 

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist yet, you're probably not alone. Search through the [issues](https://github.com/jolaleye/snap/issues) to see if someone else wants the same thing and contribute to the conversation. If the idea hasn't been brought up yet, [open an issue](https://github.com/jolaleye/snap/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) that explains the feature you'd like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

### Submitting a Contribution :sparkles:

If you've fixed a bug, added a feature, improved documentation, or done something else, you can [create a pull request](https://github.com/jolaleye/snap/pulls) to start a conversation about your changes. Make sure you've looked through this and other open source projects to get a feel for best practices and conventions. Try to adopt Snap's code style and commit messages so that your changes integrate smoothly.

Thank you for reading through this contributing guide and welcome to the community! :v: :tada:
